 images acquired from a Veridicom FPS110 fingerprint reader with 500 dpi
 for 118 individuals during the period of January 1999 and June 2002.

 characters and the tail contains the last 114 unsigned characters. 
 The fingerprint image data are located from the 9th unsigned character
 to the 90,008-th unsigned character with a sequential raster scanned order.

   The file name of each image is LijkX.raw, where ijk represents the
 number of the image donator, from 001, 002, ..., 116, and 119, 120;
